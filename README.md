# Sales_Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard-


Introduction:

In this project, I have created a Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to help the FMCG company gain valuable insights into their sales performance. By analyzing the provided sample data, the dashboard offers various visualizations and metrics that enable users to make data-driven decisions.

Features:

The Sales Analysis Dashboard incorporates the following key features:

Sales Overview: A comprehensive overview of the company's sales performance, including total sales, revenue, and profitability metrics.

Geographical Analysis: Visualizations depicting sales distribution across different regions and countries, allowing users to identify the top-performing regions.

Product Performance: Analysis of product sales performance, highlighting top-selling products, revenue generated by each product, and their contribution to overall sales.

Time-based Analysis: Trend analysis of sales over time, including monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends. This helps identify seasonality and understand sales patterns.
